# Wave Desktop

**Wave Desktop** is a powerful desktop application designed to help you manage your personal music library with ease. It offers an intuitive interface to organize, play, and manage your music collection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with the **[Wave CLI](https://github.com/ItsLhuis/Wave-CLI)**, allowing you to upload and manage music files generated by the CLI directly within the app.

## Platforms

Currently, **Wave Desktop** is fully tested and supported on **Windows**.  
If you wish to test it on **Linux** or **macOS**, you can:

1. **Modify the `release.yml` file**: Uncomment the relevant sections for Linux or macOS builds in the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) file. This will enable automated builds for those platforms.
2. **Test locally**: Clone the repository and follow the build instructions to test the app on your desired platform.

Please note that while the app is expected to work on Linux and macOS, these platforms have not been officially tested. Use at your own discretion.
